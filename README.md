It's simple project which tells something about me. The core of this app is `React.js` and first time I used `TypeScript.` I think is good way to learn. (TS is awesome)

At this moment I published this project on [darthmanu.pl](http://darthmanu.pl) where you can see it but I'll constantly work on it because I know it's not perfect.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
