        My adventure with programming started in 2017. Now I am deep into modern frontend
        technologies used for creating web applications like React Vue.JS, Nuxt and NunJucks. I
        learned how work in teams in medium size software house company MoreFromIT. There I was
        creating websites basing on mock-ups provided by graphics designers, everything was under
        great project management. Some of advanced technical details I was consulting directly with
        company&apos;s clients. The sites were created keeping in mind the main principles of SEO.

        I became interested into the Single Page Applications, meanwhile changing work to the
        TrustMate. There we were focused on the own project. I learned about useful tools for the
        frontend like FIGMA, Swagger and Zeppelin. All the time I was working in two project
        management methodologies, KANBAN and SCRUM.
